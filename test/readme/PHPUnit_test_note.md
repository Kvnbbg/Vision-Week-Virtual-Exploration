# PHPUnit test note

Remember to install PHPUnit if you haven't already:

```bash
composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit
```

You can then run your tests from the command line using PHPUnit:

```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

Make sure to replace the placeholder assertions (`assertTrue(true)`) with actual assertions that validate the expected outcomes of your database operations.
