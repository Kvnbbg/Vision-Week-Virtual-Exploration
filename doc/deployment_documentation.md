## Deploying a PHP Web App with MySQL on Heroku

This guide outlines deploying a PHP web application with a MySQL database on Heroku. Heroku is a popular Platform as a Service (PaaS) that simplifies application deployment and management.

### Prerequisites

* A Heroku account (Free tier available)
* A Github repository containing your PHP application code
* A MySQL database (locally or on another service) containing your application schema

### Deploying with GitHub Pages and Jekyll

This method involves using GitHub Pages, a static site hosting service, along with Jekyll, a static site generator, to deploy your PHP application. Follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Jekyll:**
   If you haven't already, install Jekyll and create a Jekyll site for your PHP application.

2. **Generate Static HTML:**
   Convert your PHP files into static HTML files using Jekyll. You can include PHP code in your Jekyll templates, but it will be processed during the build phase, and the resulting HTML files will be static.

3. **Commit to GitHub:**
   Commit your Jekyll site, including the generated static HTML files, to your GitHub repository.

4. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   In your GitHub repository settings, enable GitHub Pages and select the branch containing your Jekyll site (e.g., `main`). Your site will be hosted at `<username>.github.io/<repository>`.

5. **Access Your Site:**
   Once GitHub Pages builds and deploys your site, you can access it using the GitHub Pages URL for your repository.

### Deploying with Server-Side Processing on Heroku

If you require server-side processing, you'll need to deploy your PHP application on a platform that supports PHP execution. Heroku is a popular choice for PHP hosting. Here's how to deploy your PHP app on Heroku:

### Steps

1. **Create a Heroku App:**
    * Log in to your Heroku account and navigate to the "Create New App" section.
    * Choose a unique name for your application and click "Create App".

2. **Connect Heroku to Github:**
    * In your Heroku dashboard, navigate to the app settings and locate the "Deploy" section.
    * Click on "Connect to GitHub" and authorize Heroku to access your Github repositories.
    * Select the repository containing your PHP code and choose the desired branch for deployment (usually `main`).

3. **Configure Database Connection:**
    * Set up a MySQL database either locally or using a cloud service provider.
    * In your Heroku app settings, set environment variables for your database credentials (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`).

4. **Deploy your Application:**
    * Once connected to GitHub, Heroku will automatically deploy your application whenever you push code changes to your chosen branch.

### Additional Considerations

* **Security:**  
    * Follow security best practices to protect your application from common vulnerabilities.
* **Database Management:**  
    * Choose a database provider that integrates well with Heroku and offers the features you need.
* **Scaling:**  
    * Heroku provides scaling options to accommodate varying levels of traffic.
