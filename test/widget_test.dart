// This is a basic Flutter widget test.
//
// To perform an interaction with a widget in your test, use the WidgetTester
// utility in the flutter_test package. For example, you can send tap and scroll
// gestures. You can also use WidgetTester to find child widgets in the widget
// tree, read text, and verify that the values of widget properties are correct.

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';

// Assuming your main app widget is VisionWeekApp and is in lib/main.dart
// Adjust the import path if your main app widget is located elsewhere.
import 'package:vision_week_virtual_exploration/main.dart';

void main() {
  testWidgets('Counter increments smoke test', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    // Build our app and trigger a frame.
    // Replace VisionWeekApp() with your actual root app widget if different.
    await tester.pumpWidget(VisionWeekApp());

    // Verify that our counter starts at 0.
    expect(find.text('0'), findsNothing); // Assuming the counter app example is not in VisionWeekApp
    expect(find.text('1'), findsNothing); // Assuming the counter app example is not in VisionWeekApp

    // Example: Verify that some initial text or widget from your app is present.
    // This is a placeholder, you should replace it with a real test for your app.
    // For instance, if your app's first screen is WelcomeScreen and it shows 'Vision Week'
    // you might do something like:
    // expect(find.text('Vision Week'), findsOneWidget); // Adjust based on actual text on initial screen

    // This is a very basic smoke test.
    // You should write more meaningful tests for your application's specific widgets and features.
    // For example, tapping a button and verifying navigation or state change.

    // As a simple placeholder test to make flutter test pass:
    expect(find.byType(MaterialApp), findsOneWidget);
    // This just checks if a MaterialApp widget is rendered, which is usually true for Flutter apps.
  });
