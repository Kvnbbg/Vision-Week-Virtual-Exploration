## Installation

![Installation Process](img/install.png)

### Prerequisites

- Dart and Flutter SDK: [Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Gradle: [Installation Guide](https://gradle.org/install/)
- MySQL: [Installation Guide](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/installing.html)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kvnbbg/Vision-Week-Virtual-Exploration.git
   cd Vision-Week-Virtual-Exploration
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   - **Alternative**:
    ```bash
    chmod +x start_app.py
    ./start_app.py
    ```
   - **Web**: 
     ```bash
     flutter build web
     flutter run -d web
     ```
   - **Web Mobile**: 
     ```bash
     flutter run -d chrome
     ```
   - **Android/iOS (Release with Obfuscation)**:
     For enhanced security, build your release versions with obfuscation:
     ```bash
     # For Android APK
     flutter build apk --obfuscate --split-debug-info=./build/app/outputs/symbols
     # For Android App Bundle
     flutter build appbundle --obfuscate --split-debug-info=./build/app/outputs/symbols
     # For iOS
     flutter build ios --obfuscate --split-debug-info=./build/app/outputs/symbols
     ```
     (Note: Adjust `--split-debug-info` path as needed.)
   - **Desktop**:
     ```bash
     flutter build windows
     flutter build macos
     flutter build linux
     ```
     (Consider applying obfuscation to desktop builds if sensitive logic is present.)

## Running the Backend

1. **Install PHP**:
   - Download and install from [php.net](https://www.php.net/).

2. **Configure Database**:
   - Create a new database and user on your MySQL server.
   - Update the credentials in `backend/db_config.php`.

3. **Start the Server**:
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory.
   - Start the server with:
     ```bash
     php -S localhost:8000 -t public
     ```
   - **API Documentation**: As API endpoints are developed in the Slim framework (see `public/index.php`), they should be documented using OpenAPI (Swagger) specifications. Refer to `ARCHITECTURE.md` for more details.

## Testing & CI

- **Flutter Tests**: Run Flutter unit and widget tests using `flutter test`.
- **PHP Backend Tests**: PHPUnit is used for backend testing. Run tests using `composer test` (this executes `phpunit`). Ensure you have run `composer install` first.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: A CI pipeline is set up using GitHub Actions (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`). It automatically runs linters and tests on pushes and pull requests to main development branches.

## Future Development & MVP Focus

The goal is to deliver a compelling Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that validates the core virtual zoo experience and subscription model. Future development will be prioritized accordingly:

**Core MVP Features (Must-Haves):**
- **Robust Backend & Data Management**: Complete the PHP/Slim backend to reliably manage essential data:
    - Video content metadata (paths, descriptions, points of interest).
    - Curated exploration paths.
    - Basic zoo information (animals, habitats linked to videos).
- **Subscription Management**: Implement core subscription plans and payment gateway integration (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to enable the monthly subscription model.
- **Core VR Experience**: Ensure the basic VR exploration with curated video content at points of interest is functional and engaging on target VR headsets.
- **User Authentication**: Solidify user authentication using Firebase Auth.

**Post-MVP Enhancements (Should/Could-Haves, for iterative development):**
- **Video Platform Integration**: Integrate with platforms like YouTube or Vimeo for more scalable video hosting and streaming, if direct hosting becomes a bottleneck.
- **User Interactions**: Enable user comments and ratings on videos or points of interest to build community. (Consider Firebase for this).
- **Enhanced VR Features**: Improve VR experiences with more interactive elements, better graphics, and smoother navigation based on user feedback.
- **Educational Resources**: Add detailed educational resources, quizzes, or guided tours related to the animals and exhibits.
- **Admin Panel**: Develop a web-based admin panel for managing content (videos, paths, zoo information, users, subscriptions).
- **Advanced Search & Filtering**: Improve search functionality with more filters (e.g., animal type, region, duration).
- **Personalization (AI-driven)**: Offer AI-driven personalized exploration paths or content recommendations based on user behavior and preferences.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Enhance the web version with PWA capabilities for an installable, app-like experience and potential offline features.

## User Documentation

To ensure a positive user experience, especially for the novel VR interactions, consider:
- **In-App Onboarding**: Clear, concise guidance within the app for first-time users, explaining navigation, controls, and key features.
- **Simple FAQ/Help Section**: A readily accessible section answering common questions or troubleshooting basic issues.

## Deployment Strategy

A robust deployment strategy is key for delivering updates efficiently and maintaining stability. Consider the following:

**Current Considerations (as per project setup):**
- The Flutter web application can be deployed as static files to services like Netlify or Vercel.
- The PHP/Slim backend API will need a hosting environment that supports PHP (e.g., traditional web hosts, VPS, or container platforms like Docker via Back4App, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google Cloud Run).

**Recommendations:**
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Implement a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins) to automate testing, building, and deployment for both the Flutter app and the PHP backend.
- **Environment Configuration:** Manage environment-specific configurations (e.g., database credentials, API keys) securely, typically using environment variables (as implemented for `db_config.php`). Do not commit sensitive configuration directly to the repository.
- **Semantic Versioning:** Adopt semantic versioning (e.g., `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) for releases to clearly communicate the nature of changes.
- **Staged Rollouts (Mobile):** For mobile app updates (iOS/Android), utilize the staged rollout features provided by the Apple App Store and Google Play Store to gradually release new versions to users, monitoring for issues before a full rollout.
- **Database Migrations (Backend):** Implement a strategy for managing database schema changes (migrations) as the backend evolves. Tools like Phinx or Doctrine Migrations can be used with PHP.
- **Monitoring & Rollback:** Ensure adequate monitoring is in place post-deployment (leveraging observability tools). Have a plan for quick rollbacks to a previous stable version if critical issues arise.

**Note on Current Deployment Section in README:**
The current "Deployment" section mentions Netlify (good for Flutter web) and Back4App (for Docker containers - could host the PHP backend). The "Alternative Deployment Options" for Vercel also suits Flutter web. This strategy should be expanded with CI/CD and other best practices mentioned above. The reference to "Node.js application" for Back4App/Vercel should be updated if the primary backend is PHP.
